# Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

This notebook demonstrates sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model. We're using a dataset of tweets to classify sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

## Overview

This notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Setup**
   - Installing necessary libraries such as `transformers` and `datasets`.
   - Importing required Python libraries.
   - Retrieving the dataset from an online source.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading and exploring the dataset.
   - Preparing the data for model training.

3. **Model Training**
   - Initializing the DistilBERT model for sequence classification.
   - Configuring the training parameters.
   - Training the model on the dataset.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating the trained model on a test set.
   - Generating predictions on the test set.

## Instructions

To run this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   !pip install transformers datasets torch torchinfo
   ```

2. Download the dataset:
   ```bash
