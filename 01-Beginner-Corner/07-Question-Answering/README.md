# Question Answering with Hugging Face Transformers

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform question answering using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It explores the use of pre-trained models to answer questions given a context paragraph.

## Overview

The notebook provides a comprehensive guide to question answering using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It covers the installation of necessary packages, the loading of pre-trained question answering models, and the utilization of these models to answer questions based on a provided context.

## Setup and Model Loading

The notebook begins by installing the required packages, particularly the Transformers library. It loads the default pre-trained question answering model, 'distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad,' and mentions that specifying a model name and revision is recommended in production scenarios.

## Question Answering

The notebook utilizes the loaded question answering model to answer various questions based on provided context paragraphs. It includes code snippets that take a context and question as input, then outputs the answer and the corresponding score for each question-answer pair.

## Examples and Results

The notebook demonstrates the effectiveness of the question answering model by answering various questions related to different contexts. It outputs the scored answers, along with the corresponding starting and ending positions of the answer in the context.

## Note

The primary focus of this notebook is to showcase the question answering capability using pre-trained models provided by the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook includes code snippets that exhibit how the model can be used to answer different types of questions based on the provided context.
