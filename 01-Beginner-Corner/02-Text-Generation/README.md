# Text Generation Using Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline

This Jupyter Notebook illustrates text generation using the Hugging Face Transformers library and its pre-built text-generation pipeline. The notebook employs the GPT-2 model to generate text.

## Introduction

The notebook explores the process of generating text utilizing the GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It demonstrates text generation with prompts and aims to showcase the capabilities of language generation through the transformer-based model.

## Data Retrieval and Setup

The notebook begins by downloading the text data from a file containing poems by Robert Frost. It then installs the necessary `transformers` library required for leveraging the text-generation pipeline provided by Hugging Face.

## Text Generation

The notebook uses the text-generation pipeline from Hugging Face to generate text. It showcases various scenarios where the model generates text based on specific prompts, leveraging the GPT-2 model for generating sequences.

## Examples of Text Generation

It provides examples of text generation, starting from specific lines of Robert Frost's poetry. The notebook demonstrates how the model generates text based on both short and extended prompts, showcasing the capability to continue sequences in a coherent manner.

## Utility Function

The notebook introduces a utility function to format and display the generated text in a more readable form. This function wraps the text and fixes sentence endings for improved readability.

## Note

The notebook aims to display the text generation capabilities of the Hugging Face Transformers library using the GPT-2 model. It's encouraged to adapt and explore this notebook to generate text based on different prompts or adapt it for specific project requirements.
