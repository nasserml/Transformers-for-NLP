# Masked Language Modeling Using Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform masked language modeling (MLM) using the pre-built pipeline. The notebook focuses on leveraging the MLM pipeline for text generation and prediction.

## Introduction

The notebook explores the concept of masked language modeling using Hugging Face's Transformers library. It exhibits how the MLM technique fills in masked tokens within a sentence to predict the most probable word or phrase using pre-trained language models.

## Data Retrieval and Setup

The notebook begins by retrieving the dataset from the BBC Full Text Document Classification available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamkushwaha/bbc-full-text-document-classification). It fetches the dataset containing text documents for various categories.

## Masked Language Modeling

The notebook utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers' pipeline for masked language modeling. It demonstrates the process of filling masked tokens in text sequences to predict the most appropriate words or phrases using pre-trained models.

## Examples of Masked Language Modeling

The notebook provides examples of masked language modeling by using the `fill-mask` pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers. It showcases how the model predicts missing words or phrases in sentences with masked tokens.

## Notes

The notebook's main focus is to illustrate how to use the Transformers library's MLM pipeline for text prediction and generation. Users can experiment with different texts, contexts, and masking to understand the language model's ability to predict masked tokens accurately.
